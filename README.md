# meli-frontend-challenge

This is my solution for Mercado Libre frontend challenge.

You can visit the demo here: https://meli-frontend-challenge-six.vercel.app/

The app and API were built with:

1. Next JS

   1.1. API Routes

   1.2 Dynamic Routes

2. Typescript
3. CSS in JS with Stitches.dev
4. A lot of ðŸ’œ

Deployed in Vercel

## API Routes

1. [https://meli-frontend-challenge-six.vercel.app/api/items?q=celular](https://meli-frontend-challenge-six.vercel.app/api/items?q=celular).
   You can change search anything you want changing the value after `q=`

2. [https://meli-frontend-challenge-six.vercel.app/api/items/MLA906705910](https://meli-frontend-challenge-six.vercel.app/api/items/MLA906705910)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
